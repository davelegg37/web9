Energy - Most of the energy we consume comes from fossil fuels
Energy infrastructure - digging, drilling, pumping, transporting, grids, dynamos,
Agriculture. - Plowing, planting, fertilizing, harvesting, selling, all use oil
Agriculture infrastructure- Big farms, big markets, farms far from tables requiring transportation.
Structures residential-Big houses far from workplace, shopping, friends and family

		<div>Stuck in a web of oil (How to survive the climate collapse)
This game is about survival. Not just your survival but of all your fellow humans alive today and those just entering life on earth tomorrow and the foreseeable future. We are all trapped in the web of oil which we created and continue to expand today.
The web is constructed by oil. All of the ways we consume it and maintain and extend it tightens its grip on us.The only way out is to quit oil which means to sacrifice your present present life style for one focused on survival. If you're living a comfortable high consumption lifestyle of the West that may seem impossible but it isn't. Others have sacrificed for survival. The survivors of WWII torn Europe, Asia, etc did.  Present day climate refugees trying to escape with what they can are. It is not a question of whether humans can do it but will humans do it. Do we have the will to survive our own destruction. This game lets you practice your survival skills.
The game begins with humanity trapped in a web of oil constructed of eight strands of oil and the only way it can survive is to remove four of those strands. The only way to remove strands is to give up stuff. At the beginning of the game you are given a choice of how much stuff you are willing to give up. The more stuff you are willing to give up the easier it is to remove the four strands and escape the web but the greater the decline in lifestyle and comfort level. Your goal is to escape the web with least amount of loss in lifestyle and comfort level.
Your goal is the survival of humanity with the least cost in lifestyle and comfort.
Stuff levels are the amount of stuff you are willing to give up to free humanity from the web. The more stuff the easier it will be to remove the strands but the greater your sacrifice of comfort and lifestyle.
Stuff level 1. The average American is willing to give up $177 a year. And a few gestural actions but nothing that really affects their basic life style. The lifestyle score in the game is -1
Stuff level 2. Think of Americans mobilization for WWII, rationing, focusing the whole country and all it's production capability on the war effort. A national draft to fight climate collapse. Cost -5.
Stuff level 3.  Think today's climate refugees. Yeman, Syria, victims of natural disasters, the people on the front lines of climate wars. Cost -20
How much stuff would you be willing to give up. The goal is to save humanity with the least cost to lifestyle and comfort. It seems obvious that saving humanity is primary and comfort level is secondary but trying to do both is the problem.  </div>
